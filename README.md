# Portfolio Web Site for Jeff Stewart
>*Good Design Solves Problems*

Hello, my name is Jeff Stewart and I currently design and develop accessible Front-End Web experiences for the Federal Government. I started my career out in Public Affairs for the U.S. Navy and I am now currently working for the National Finance Center (USDA) in New Orleans, Louisiana.

My day to day workflow usually varies between creating new layouts for various projects and Front-End coding. I also serve as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) on 508/WACG 2.0 compliance for my Agency. While I focus on design I have lately been branching out into content marketing and have helped to streamline my Agency's communications through email templates and video products. I occasionly provide print and other graphical layouts to support our Web assets.

Please feel free to view the examples of my work that I have provided and also the code for this Web site. Built using only `HTML5` and `CSS3` with a few `SVG` elements thrown in, the pages are responsive and should load fairly quickly over slower networks. If you like the code and want to use it for your own projects please feel free.
